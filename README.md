# Introduction

## What is KuSwap?

KuSwap is a community-driven ecosystem that integrates and enhances the best features of the leading decentralized exchanges in the cryptocurrency market to give users a secure environment to trade cryptocurrencies, while keeping a pleasant and engaging ambiance. 

While many existing Defi applications focus on one or two core competencies, KuSwap raises the bar for Defi by introducing new methods for users to connect with the ecosystem's various capabilities in a simple & user-friendly manner.

KuSwap's key components, which will be explained in detail throughout this paper, include a decentralized exchange, a decentralized lending market, yield farming, staking derivatives, an IDO launchpad, predictions, and an NFT Marketplace, as well as a community-centered contest section. 

While the core team oversees day-to-day operations such as pool rebalancing, business development, marketing, and even community contests, the community votes on key architecture and fundamental changes using the KUS Token.

KuSwap is designed to be user-friendly and secure for all users, from novices to experts. Various levels of application security and support are integrated into the platform to accomplish this. The core team investigated and corrected problems discovered during an audit of Sushiswap, the exchange from which it branched.

Additionally, with a revolutionary user-first design that places a premium on user experience as a primary driver of company development, KuSwap intends to create a decentralized exchange that belongs to its users by delivering many services all in the same KUS token that powers, feeds, and drives the ecosystem. The goal of KuSwap is to become the de facto trading protocol of the Kucoin Community Chain, facilitating seamless trade for KRC20 tokens while getting rid of unnecessary third parties and fees.

Where it makes tradeoffs, decentralization, censorship resistance, and security are prioritized.
